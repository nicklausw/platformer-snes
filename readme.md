# platformer
Well, sort of a platformer. It's my attempt at one
on the SNES. It's going alright I guess.

To make, be sure you have ca65, ld65, python 3,
and an emulator of choice. If you've got it all, then modify
the makefile to point to these. Then just
type 'make' in the terminal, and there you go.
